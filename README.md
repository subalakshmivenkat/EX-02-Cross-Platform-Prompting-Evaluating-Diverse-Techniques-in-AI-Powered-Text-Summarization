# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm

## Step 1: Choose Platforms
Select 4 AI platforms for testing:

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Gemini (Google)

Claude (Anthropic)

Copilot (Microsoft/OpenAI)

## Step 2: Select Prompting Techniques
Apply each of the following techniques:

Zero-shot: “Summarize this article.”

Few-shot: Provide 1-2 examples of summaries before the main request.

Chain-of-thought: Add reasoning steps to guide the summarization (e.g., “First, identify key concepts…”).

Role-based: Assign a role to the AI (e.g., “You are an educator summarizing for undergraduate students…”).

## Step 3: Prepare Input
Use a single 500-word technical article on The Basics of Blockchain Technology.

## Step 4: Prompt Execution
Run the same article through each platform using all four prompting techniques (16 combinations total).

## Step 5: Evaluate Outputs
Rate each result on the following criteria:

Accuracy (0–5)

Coherence (0–5)

Simplicity (0–5)

Speed (record response time in seconds)

User Experience (subjective rating 0–5)

## Step 6: Analyze Results
Aggregate scores to identify patterns and determine the most effective platform + technique combination.

## Result
